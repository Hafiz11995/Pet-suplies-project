{"cells":[{"source":"# Introduction \nPetMind is a retailer of products for pets. They are based in United States.\nThey sells products that are a mix of luxury items and everybody items. Luxury items include toys, Everyday itesm include food.\nThe company wants to increase sales by selling more everyday products repeatedly.\nThey want a report on how the repeat purhases impact sales.\n\nI was given two weeks by the manager of the PetMind to find out about how the repeat purchases impact sales. I asked some questions to analysed the dataset given to me.\nThe questions are:\n    - State which category of the variable repeat purchases has the most observations\n    - Explain whether the observations are balanced across categories of the variable repeat purchases \n    - Describe the distribution of all sales\n    - Describe the relationship between repeat purchases and sales.\n\nFrom my observation about the dataset, I discovered some errors and did some cleaning, transforming, analyzing and visualizing the data.\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### DATA VALIDATION\nThe original data is **1500 rows** and **8 columns**. I will explain what I did by each columns in cleaning below;\n\n- **product_id:** This is the unique identifier of the product, there were no missing values as it’s impossible due to the database structure. It’s exactly as expected.\n- **category:** This is the category of the products, which includes Housing, Food, Toys, Equipment, Medicine and Accessory. But this field had some errors, it contain some records **“-“** which is not part of the category given. There are **25 values** that contained -. This - make is difficult to get the correct data type, hence I had to replace all the value that contained - with the overall “Unknown”. We now have 7 different category. There are no missing values. This field contained 1500 distinct values and 7 unique values. \n- **animal:** This is the type of animal the product is for. The type of animal are Dog, Cat, Fish and Bird. This field contained no errors, and there are no missing values. There are **1500 distinct values** and **4 unique values**.\n- **size:** In this field, there were errors as some values have the same meaning but they were separated by various different capitalizations. Further analysis showed that this was due to inconsistency in size name. For instance, we have **9 different sizes** which was analyzed. In order to correct this, I converted all of them to **lower cases** leaving just **3 different** sizes as provided. There are no missing value in this field. \n- **price:** This is the price the product is sold at. The datatype was an object type and I had to change it to a numeric type because the field contain some record **“NA”** which is an error as it’s impossible to sell a product without a price. I replaced the value that contained NA with the **“overall median price”** which was **29.42** and rounded the values in the field to **2 decimal place**. There were no missing values. The number of NA before the replacing was **150**.\n- **sales:** This is the value of all sales of the product in the last year. There were no any missing value and contained no errors. I rounded the values in the field to **2 decimal place**.\n- **rating:**  This is the customer rating of the product from **1 to 10**. There was **150 missing values** in this field. I replaced those missing values with **zero**. This field contained **1500 distinct values** and **11 unique values**.\n- **repeat_purchases:** This means whether customers repeatedly buy the product **(1)** or not **(0)**. There are no missing value here, hence I didn’t remove any row. There are **150 distinct values** and **2 unique values**.\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# DATA INSIGHT","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9020e0a4-43a5-490a-8a52-630783b16bac"},{"source":"![](repeat_purchase.png)\n\n\n**Note:** Let’s not forget that **1** mean repeatedly buying product while **0** mean not repeatedly buying product.\nFrom this observation we can see that customers repeatedly purchases product from the store more than those who do not. Out of 1500 products, 906 of them repeatedly purchases product while 594 do not repeatedly buy the products. This mean that about 60% of the product was repeatedly brought from the store. \n\n**-State which category of the variable repeat purchases has the most\nobservations**\nFrom the graph above, we can see that equipment is the category with the most observation with repeatedly purchases products.\nOf all these products, equipment has repeatedly buy the most with 24.4% of total repeatedly purchases. Equipment is also the most bought category with 370 purchases in total. The top 3 category include equipment with 370 total purchases, followed by medicine with 237 total purchases and the third position is housing with 227 total purchases. This will suggest that the team should focus more on providing more equipment as they are common.\n\n**- Explain whether the observations are balanced across categories of the\nvariable repeat purchases**\nFrom the observation, we want to know whether the categories of the repeatedly purchases are balanced or not. Category such as Food, Housing, Medicine and Toys have more than 150 repeat purchases and are said to be similarily balanced, with only Equipment, Accessory and Unknown being the extreme values or outliners. Equipment which 370 repeat purhases have the high extreme values  while Accessory and Unknown have the low extreme value with the Unknown being the lowest outliner as it has under 100 repeat purchases. Hence, we can agree from the observation that the category of the products of repeat purchases are somewhat balanced. So when the team is looking for products that have repeat purchases of more than 150.\n","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Distribution of sales\n![The distribution of  all sales](sales_values.png)\n \nAs we can see, the graph shown a normal distribution of the sales, this mean that the distribution of sale is symmetric and most of the sales values cluster around the mean which is 996.60.\n\n\n![The distribution of  all sales](density.png)\n\nAs we can see again, the graph gives us a clearer view of understanding. It shown a normal distribution of the sales, this mean that the distribution of sale is symmetric and most of the sales values cluster around the mean.\n\n\n![](violin_plot.png)\n\n\nFuther information about the distribution of sales from the above graph are as follow;\n- **count:** 1500.00\n- **mean:** 996.60\n- **std:** 323.95\n- **min:** 286.94\n- **25%:** 747.42 \n- **50%:** 1000.83\n- **75%:** 1158.16\n- **max:** 2255.96\n\nAs we can see from the above information the average sales is 996.60, the standard deviation is 323.95, the min sales is 286.94, the max sales is 2255.96. \n","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![Relationship between Repeat Purchases and Sales](sales_vs_repeat.png)\n\n\nFinally, we want to know how repeat purchases impacts the sales. 0 which represent customer that didn't repeatedly purchases tend to makes more sales than customers that repeatedly purchases. We can see that they are pf little differences. There's no any direct or idirect impact. We've also seen some outliners is above 1750. The ouliners didn't make the comparison difficult.  But let's take a look without the ouliners.\n\n\n\n![Relationship between Repeat Purchases and Sales](sales_vs_repeat2.png)\n\n\nAs we can see 0 have more than 1. There is also not much differrence between them. we suggest there should be further analysis to check if there is any impact betweem repeat purchases and sales to fully understand.\n\n### RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the all of above, we recommend that the team should focus on targeting equipments but also not ignore other such as food, housing, medicine and toys. \n","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
